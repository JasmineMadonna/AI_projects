Question 3

run command: python MarkovChain.py Auth_dir prob_file result_file

I use package nltk to tokenize. Use choice function to do weigthed random selection.

In the result file the probability is given as list under each generated sequence. (First prob corresponds to first unigram, second second word given first word prob, third onwards trigram probability)

For extra credit - File is MarkovChain_EC.py
run as : python MarkovChain_EC.py Auth_dir1 Auth_dir2 prob_file1 prob_file2 result_file
