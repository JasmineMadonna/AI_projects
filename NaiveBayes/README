Question 2
For NaiveBayes.py
python3.5 NaiveBayes.py Train.csv Test.csv Model-file Result-file

In the model file I first print the class probabilities. Then I print the conditional probabilities for each attribute like a table as follows:

Attribute: Attribute_name

	Class 0		Class 1
a	P(a|class 0)	P(a|class 1)
b	P(b|class 0)	P(b|class 1)
.....
...

I use pandas to read the csv file.
